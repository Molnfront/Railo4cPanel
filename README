The Railo4cPanel project makes it easy for any hosting company to offer Railo
as a value-added service to their cPanel services.

Set your hosting company apart from the hosting crowd and give your clients
the gift of the open-source CFML language!

To build the Railo4cPanel .run file, download this repository and run the
following command on any CentOS-based server:

# cd railo4cpanel/
# ./make_railo4cpanel.sh

This will produce a self-extracting Railo4cPanel installer that you may run
on any system that has WHM/cPanel 11.34 installed on it. Other versions of
WHM/cPanel may function, but only 11.34 has been tested so far.
